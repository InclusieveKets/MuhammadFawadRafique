# Welcome to my FABLab site

I am passionate about technology since childhood. I came to know about FAB Academy Worksop from [Masala Gent](http://masalagent.be), a non-profit organisation. By following this workshop, my dream of making almost anything from scratch has finally come true.

During the next 15 weeks, you would find all my project development on this website. You can access each week progress by clicking on the respective week.
